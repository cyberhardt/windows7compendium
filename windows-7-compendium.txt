Links present in the Winraid forum thread:

AMD official USB driver modified version (Especially ASUS motherboard must use this version):
https://disk.yandex.ru/d/46C89LbaeVqVqw 328

Users who are not ASUS motherboards strongly recommend using this driver package, which supports UASP and better compatibility（This package also can work for Intel and Zhaoxin platforms）:https://disk.yandex.ru/d/0FqOqmzQjnAulQ 251

If you meet A5 BSOD, you can use mod acpi.sys to replace the file use PE system:
Replace C:\Windows\system32\drivers\acpi.sys
Replace C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\acpi.inf_amd64_neutral_476d4b744f1f6916\acpi.sys
MOD acpi.sys download link:https://disk.yandex.ru/d/4jeNfg1seOJ4oQ 275

If you don’t know how to have a full patch win7. Here is the English win7 pro x64 install image with drivers that support AMD platforms（Not support ASUS mainboards）. You can use USB PE system to use tools install it：https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtTpD7JSBIarhJsDr2mj9qvEdTFqYQ?e=yDayfg 220

iv - (Ungoogled) Chromium: 108.0.5359.125
     ∟ this version has an annoying warning, so I recommend using some previous ones. related threads on github: https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/issues/2187, https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows/issues/193, https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/discussions/2173. Firefox and its forks are compatible.

     ∟ this version lacks wireguard. I recommend downloading standalone wireguard, and then importing your settings as per: https://mullvad.net/en/help/tag/wireguard/

On the Pandora Compendium, each program has a letter indicating whether it works on Windows 7 or not. This is just a brief list of some of them.

Remember: Unsupported =/= Incompatible. Unsupported programs might work.

Always save web pages and download useful software like those to prevent stuff from getting lost. Also save SOURCE CODE of stable win7 supported versions of software as well as their respective working builds.
