iv - Chromium: 108.0.5359.125
     ∟ this version has an annoying warning, so I recommend using some previous ones. related threads on github: https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/issues/2187, https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium-windows/issues/193, https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium/discussions/2173
